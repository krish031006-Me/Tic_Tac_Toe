# Tic_Tac_Toe
This is my first project

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using Python. This game allows two players to compete against each other in a command-line interface.

<b>1. Features:<b>

  Two-player mode

  Detects win, loss, and draw conditions

  Simple command-line interface

  User-friendly prompts for input

2. Installation & Usage:

  Clone the repository:

  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
  
  cd tic-tac-toe

  Run the game:

3. How to Play:

  Players take turns entering their moves (X or O) by selecting a position (1-9) on the grid.

  The game will check for a winner after every move.

  If all spots are filled and no player has won, the game declares a draw.
